# CSS calc() Function Issues
This repository demonstrates common problems and solutions associated with using the CSS `calc()` function. The `bug.css` file showcases problematic `calc()` usage, while `bugSolution.css` provides corrected implementations.  The primary issues addressed include handling of percentages, unit compatibility, proper spacing, and consideration of browser inconsistencies.

## Issues:
- Unexpected results from percentage-based calculations within nested elements.
- Errors due to incompatible units used within a single `calc()` expression.
- Parsing errors caused by incorrect spacing in `calc()` expressions.
- Browser-specific rendering differences.
