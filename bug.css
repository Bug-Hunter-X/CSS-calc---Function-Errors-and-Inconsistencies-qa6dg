The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, using `calc()` with percentages and other units can sometimes lead to unexpected results, particularly when dealing with nested elements and complex layouts.  For example,  `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not behave as expected in all contexts.  Another issue can arise when combining `calc()` with units that aren't directly compatible, causing parsing errors. Incorrect spacing within the `calc()` expression (e.g., missing spaces between operators and operands) can also cause problems.  Finally, browser inconsistencies in the interpretation of `calc()` expressions may occur, leading to differences in rendering across various browsers.
